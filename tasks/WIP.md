# Work In Progress

Active work being done by agents. Each section is removed once the branch is merged.

## post-rebrand: external service rename cascade (tracking only)

**Why:** PR #98 merged the GymBuddy → RepSaga code rename. Codebase is 100% clean
(zero `gymbuddy`/`GymBuddy` refs post-merge). This section tracks external
services and manual actions that still need renaming outside the repo. Not a
branch — purely a coordination checklist.

### GitHub

- [x] **Rename repo** `gymbuddy-app` → `repsaga` (done; local `origin` updated; old URL auto-redirects)
- [x] **Rename local folder** — Claude Code session now runs in `C:\Users\caiol\Projects\repsaga` (folder + memory dir already migrated)

### Google Cloud Platform

- [x] **Fresh GCP project** `repsaga-prod` created; old `gymbuddy-app-proj` shut down (2026-04-22, see `docs/gcp-project-recreation.md`)
- [x] **Pub/Sub topic** `repsaga-rtdn` created in `repsaga-prod`; Play granted publisher; Play Console RTDN pointed at `projects/repsaga-prod/topics/repsaga-rtdn`
- [x] **Pub/Sub push subscription** `repsaga-rtdn-push` → `rtdn-webhook` Edge Function (OIDC-authed, test notification returns 200)

### Supabase

- [ ] **Project display name** — Dashboard → Project Settings → General → rename to "RepSaga"
- [ ] **Auth redirect URLs allowlist** — Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration → add `io.supabase.repsaga://login-callback/` **when Google Sign-In is enabled** (Phase 16b+). Not blocking today since only email/password auth is wired.
- [x] **Edge Function secrets** — `GOOGLE_PLAY_PACKAGE_NAME=com.repsaga.app`, `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (new `repsaga-prod` SA), `RTDN_PUBSUB_AUDIENCE` all set; Edge Functions redeployed (2026-04-22)

### Google Play Console (blocked → now unblocked)

- [x] **Create app** with package `com.repsaga.app` — unblocks Phase 16a Stages 1.3, 3.4, 4, 5.3
- [ ] **Create subscription product** `repsaga_premium` (code + test fixtures already expect this ID)
- [x] **Link service account** — `repsaga-play-api@repsaga-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` invited via Users and permissions (new flow; old API-access page deprecated by Google ~2024)
- [x] **Point Play at Pub/Sub topic** — `projects/repsaga-prod/topics/repsaga-rtdn`; test notification verified end-to-end (Play → Pub/Sub → `rtdn-webhook` 200)

### Brand assets

- [ ] **Domains** — register `repsaga.com`, `repsaga.app`, `repsaga.com.br`
- [ ] **Social handles** — lock `@repsaga` on Instagram, X/Twitter, TikTok

### Local development environment

- [x] **IntelliJ/Android Studio** — stale `.iml` files + `.idea/modules.xml` deleted; IDE will regenerate with `repsaga` names on next open
- [x] **Claude Code memory dir** — migrated to `C--Users-caiol-Projects-repsaga\memory\`; MEMORY.md index loads correctly this session

### Not renameable (stuck forever — fine)

- Supabase project ref `dgcueqvqfyuedclkxixz` — internal ID, appears in `.env` as part of the Supabase URL
- Android keystore signing certificate (cryptographic; key alias is internal-only)
- Git commit history (correct historical record)

### Acceptance

All checklist items above completed. Phase 16a external setup can proceed with `com.repsaga.app` everywhere.
